Geometric Group Theory Research

Geometric Group Theory is a field of mathematics that emereged in the 1980s. The basic idea is to use geometry to study groups, and vice versa. For example, the integers are a group. If you add two integers, you get another integer. Every integer (e.g. -5) has a an inverse (e.g. 5) that brings you back to the identity element (zero in this case). To treat the integers as a geometric object, draw a number line as you did in elementary school. There will be a node for each integer and an edge of length 1 connecting adjacent integers. My thesis focuses on a class of groups built by 'adjoining' the integers and the universal Coxeter group. We can represent the universal Coxeter group with a tree. Trees have many interesting geometric properties. For exapmle, trees are hyperbolic! The integers are also hyperbolic. What happens when we 'adjoin' these two groups? It depends!
